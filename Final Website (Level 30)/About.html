  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <center><img src="Me1.jpg" alt="Your Photo" width="200" height="200"></center>
  <p>Hello, my name is Ryan Eastwood and I am an artist based in Greensboro, NC.</p>
  <p>I'm currently studying at UNCG pursuing a BFA in New Media & Design</p>
  <p>I mainly focus in hand-drawn mediums, however I enjoy dabbling in digital and photography based work from time to time as well.</p>
  <p>Art has always held a special place in my art as a way to express myself visually rather than simply through speech.</p>
  <p>I've studied and been inspired by the works of Andy Warhol, Picasso, Jeff Koons and countless others.</p>
  <p>I'm constantly looking for new inspirations and to push myself further as an artist by experimenting with new things all the time.</p>
